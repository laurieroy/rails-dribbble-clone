# DRIBBBLE CLONE

This is a dribbble clone that follows a tutorial by Andy Leverenz. I built in Rails 6, so used image_processing instead of carrierwave for image uploads. 

### GEMS USED

* Bulma UI
* Devise for authentication
* Dropzone and Stimulus.js for drag and drop
* Active Storage for handling the file/image
