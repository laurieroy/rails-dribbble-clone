# DRIBBBLE CLONE

This is a dribbble clone (feed only) that follows a 2017 [tutorial](https://web-crunch.com/posts/lets-build-dribbble-clone-with-ruby-on-rails) by Andy Leverenz. I built in Rails 6, so used image_processing instead of carrierwave for image uploads. 

Features: Logged in users can comment on shots and like, view counts, user roles, drag-n-drop photo add

<!-- custom Devise route -->

### GEMS USED

* Bulma UI
* Devise for authentication
* Dropzone and Stimulus.js for drag and drop
* Active Storage for handling the file/image
